# Gaussian Process

"a prior distribution over functions and updating this distribution by conditioning on the data"

Note:
Properties of the Gaussian distribution and Bayes theorem gives Gaussian process. 


## a prior distribution over functions
### What is Gaussian about a Gaussian process?
Shows plots of 2d distributions and relationship between points on a line


## Covariance functions: The important ingredient
How the functions are allowed to behave.

Show samples via circular plots for:
* exponential with different lengthscales
* perodic
* brownian
* combination?


## conditioning on data
Show fitting a Gaussian process from prior to points (use real world example co2 data?)
