## The Gaussian distribution

$p(x) \sim N(\mu|\sigma^2)$

$p(x) \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{ -\frac{1}{2}( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2 S }$

Add graph of 1D Gaussian

Note:
Gaussians used for: 
* Very common by nature. Almost all variables are distributed approximately normally.
* Measurement errors in physical experiments are often modeled by a normal distribution
Central limit theorem (CLT): in many situations, when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a "bell curve") even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed


## The Multivariate Gaussian

$p(\pmb x) \sim N(\pmb \mu|\Sigma)$

$p(\pmb x) \sim \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2} \; |\Sigma|^{1/2}}e^{ -\frac{1}{2}(\pmb x - \pmb \mu)^t \Sigma^{-1}(\pmb x - \pmb \mu)}$
